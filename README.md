# Timber Measurement Mobile Application
<img align="right" src="/.doc/thumbnail2.png" width="400"></img>
This project is a mobile application that I created in Ionic framework. It is a specialized tool for timber trading business, where it documents measurements of logs and performs related calculations. It offers a functionality to print final output as paper document directly in the field.
